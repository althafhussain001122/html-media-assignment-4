HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or characters that are not easily typable on a standard keyboard. 
They are often used to display reserved characters, 
such as angle brackets (< and >), special characters, and symbols, without causing interpretation issues in HTML.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:-

(1) `&lt`; - Less Than:
Represents the less-than sign <. This entity is used to display the less-than symbol without triggering HTML interpretation.
Example: <p>This is an example &lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;.</p>

(2)`&gt;` - Greater Than:
Represents the greater-than sign `>`. Similar to `&lt;`, this entity is used to display the greater-than symbol without causing HTML interpretation.
Example: <p>For more information, visit our website &gt; <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

(3)`&amp;` - Ampersand:
Represents the ampersand `&`. 
This entity is used to display the ampersand symbol without conflicting with HTML syntax. 
It is especially crucial when including parameters or entities within URLs.
Example: <p>For further details, contact us &amp; we'll assist you.</p>

(4)`&quot;` - Double Quote:
Represents the double quotation mark `"` character.
 This entity is used to display double quotes within HTML attributes,
 preventing them from being interpreted as the beginning or end of an attribute value.
Example: <p>The title of the book is "Gone with the Wind".</p> 

(5)`&copy;` - Copyright Symbol:
Represents the copyright symbol Â©. This entity is used to display the copyright symbol on a web page. 
It is often used in legal notices and attributions.
Example: <p>&copy; 2023 It is never too late to be what you might have been.</p>

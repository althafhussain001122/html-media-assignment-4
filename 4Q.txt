(1 )Semantic HTML Elements:
Use semantic HTML elements to convey the structure and meaning of content.
 Semantic elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`, provide 
 a clear document structure that aids users with screen readers and other assistive technologies in understanding the content. 
 Additionally, use heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)
 in a logical hierarchy to create a meaningful outline of the document.

 (2)Provide Alternative Text for Images:
Provide Alternative Text for Images:

Include descriptive alternative text for images using the `alt` attribute. This text is crucial for users who rely on screen readers, as it provides a textual description of the image. Ensure that the alternative text conveys the purpose and meaning of the image.

(3) Use Color with Care: Color plays an important role in web design, but it should not be the only means of
conveying information. Ensure that color is not the sole indicator of meaning. For example, when using error
messages, pair color with text that explains the error. Additionally, maintain sufficient color contrast between
text and background to enhance readability for users with low vision.
